      \n___\n\n__The objectives:__\n\n1. Build a data repository that stores up to\
      \ date public data relevant to Utilities (eg, socio-economic information from\
      \ the Office of National Statistics, geospatial data from the Ordnance Survey,,\
      \ National Grid ESO. etc);  those datasets are processed and exposed in ways\
      \ that allow for easy utilisation by any authorised party. For example, socio\
      \ economic statistics such as population or average income are computed for\
      \ comparable spatial units (Local Authorities, MSOAs, LSOAs).\n\n2. Build a\
      \ meta database that takes inputs from the DNO, GDN, Water, NHS, Police, Fire,\
      \ Council etc. The purpose is to help these bodies share data in a better way\
      \ in alignment with the 17 SDG Goals. The granularity of those inputs is typically\
      \ to address level, and they contain Personal Information so data must be protected\
      \ by strict security and privacy framework.\n\n3. Use the Google Analytics Hub\
      \ concept to frame a secure solution that would allow Utilities and other parties\
      \ that operate as \"publishers\" (charities, local authorities, etc.) to catalog,\
      \ use, input, share and control both public data and their own datasets.\n\n\

      \ allows you to explore and analyse a wide range of public data relating to\
      \ fuel poverty in the UK. \n\nCurrently, this dashboard is populated with publicly\
      \ available data sets (shown below). This version of the dashboard is designed\
      \ to give users an understanding of the type of analytics that is possible with\
      \ Google's BigQuery and Looker.  \n\nMost of the information presented in this\
      \ dashboard is raw historical data. There are certain situations where the past\
      \ data has been carried into the future and  estimates have been made for future\
      \ energy costs and consumption. Any assumptions made will be explicitly stated\
      \ at each visualization.  \n\n___\n\n__Data Sources__\n\n| Data        | Frequency\
